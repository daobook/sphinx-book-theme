"Install `tox`. `tox` is a tool for managing virtual environments for test"

"your environment is consistent each time you build the docs or run tests."

"This will build the documentation using the latest version of the theme "

"You can bundle both of the steps above into a single command, which also "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/setup.md:100
msgid "To do so, use this `tox` command:"
