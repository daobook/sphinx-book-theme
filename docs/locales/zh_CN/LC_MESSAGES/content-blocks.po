"There are two different kinds of sidebar-like content in `sphinx-book-"
"theme`, typical `{sidebar}` directives, as well as a theme-specific "
"`{margin}` directive. This section covers both. Both allow you to place "
"extra content separately from your main content."

"Sidebar content will generally overlap with the white space where your "
"site's table of contents lives. When the reader scrolls sidebar content "

"You can specify content that should exist in the right margin. This will "

"The `{margin}` directive allows you to create margin content with your "
"own title and content block. It is a wrapper around the Sphinx "
"`{sidebar}` directive, and largely does its magic via CSS classes (see "

"You may also directly add CSS classes to elements on your page in order "
"to make them behave like margin content. To do so, add the `margin` CSS "
"class to any element on the page. Many Sphinx directives allow you to "
"directly add classes. For example, here's the syntax to add a `margin` "
"class to a `{note}` directive:"
