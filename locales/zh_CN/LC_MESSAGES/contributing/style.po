#: ../../contributing/style.md:10
msgid ""
"**Use minimalistic visual elements.** This theme should not have \"strong"
" visual opinions\" beyond a clean and minimal design. For example, use "
"whitespace instead of color blocks to separate content, use unintrusive "
"visual elements where possible, use color sparingly, etc."

#: ../../contributing/style.md:12
msgid ""
"**Focus on a single book use-case.** This theme is designed for the use-"
"case where a person has documentation for a single reader archetype, "
"where all aspects of the documentation may be exposed to the reader. This"
" means we follow a two-column layout with a single navigation bar across "
"all pages. Header navigation should require more customization."

"**Add design elements from the Tufte theme**. The [Edward Tufte CSS "
"theme](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) defines several styles "
"and elements that are unique for communicating ideas with data. We give a"
" few of these (like margin content) special treatment, and generally "
"assume Tufte knows what he's doing."
