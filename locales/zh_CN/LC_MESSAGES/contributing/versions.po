"**Release early and often**. If it has been more than a few weeks since "
"the last release, anybody is encouraged to make a new one. Releases "
"should be as painless and automated as possible."

"**Roughly follow semver**. See [our SemVer guide](releases:semver) for "
"interpretation of what this means."

msgid ""
"**We can always make another release**. Don't try to get everything "
"perfect before a release. Favor making more releases more quickly rather "
"than fewer bigger releases."

"This theme roughly follows the [SemVer](https://semver.org) versioning "

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:26

"**Major versions**: Significant refactoring of theme structure or "
"functionality that requires major re-configurations for users and "
"developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:27
msgid ""
"**Minor versions**: Most enhancements and tweaks to theme behavior. This "
"is the majority of version bumps."

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:29

"**Patch versions**: Tiny bugfixes and very minor improvements that "
"trigger a release right when they are implemented."

"**Do not worry about it too much**. Don't take too much energy in "
"deciding and debating versions. Life is too short to worry about getting "
"the perfect version number, just go with your gut (or ask another person "
"if you really wish)."

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:37
msgid ""
"**It is more important to document a breaking change properly**. When we "
"make breaking changes, the important thing is to properly document them "
"and create deprecation warnings and pathways. This should get more energy"
" than deciding whether to bump the major/minor version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:41
msgid ""
"**Major version bumps should be for truly major overhauls**. We're likely"
" be breaking things here and there throughout, not every single breaking "
"change. Reserve major version changes for significant overhauls (for "
"example, ones that require someone to comprehensively re-work their CSS "
"rules)."

#: ../../contributing/versions.md:45
msgid ""
"**Major versions do not have any special meaning other than semver**. "
"While we generally try not to bump major versions, they also carry no "
"special meaning other than reflecting how much changed since the last "
"version. We try to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) and this is all "
"that major versions signify. We don't make any promises about long term "
"support and stability."
